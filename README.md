# Lightning Demo App with VueJS

View the demo - [https://lightning-tv.github.io/vue-demo-app/](https://lightning-tv.github.io/vue-demo-app/)

## Getting started

Get an api key from [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
and put the key in `src/api/key.js` with `export default 'KEY_VALUE'`

```
git clone https://github.com/lightning-tv/vue-demo-app
cd vue-demo-app
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

## Work in Progress

Right now the browse page works and you can infinite scroll down. But if you navigate elsewhere, still a lot of pages needing to be built. Open to help / PRs - trying to duplicate the https://github.com/lightning-tv/solid-demo-app
